        <h2>EVERA mission</h2>
        <p>EVERA is a space where voices never fade. We carefully transform memories, speech, values, and personal histories into a digital portrait that future generations, students, and researchers can speak with. It is not an archive or a form — it is a living dialogue across years.</p>
        <p>You preserve what must not be lost: intonations, signature expressions, biographical facts, and emotional highlights. The result is a digitised memory and digital legacy that remains accessible to the family — and, if you wish, to the world.</p>

        <h2>What is EVERA?</h2>
        <p>EVERA is a methodology and platform for creating digital immortality in the language of the family and culture. We collect audio and video interviews, letters, photographs, and documents, build a biographical timeline, and capture lexical style together with emotional markers. These materials become a digital portrait able to sustain thematic conversations.</p>
        <p>Unlike cold archives or formal questionnaires, EVERA enables dialogue. Ask about childhood, turning points, values, or the family tree — and receive answers grounded in real speech, semantic clusters, and verified facts. It is a digitised personality that respects context and boundaries.</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p class="sub">Interviews → Analytics → Dialogue. Carefully, transparently, with no mysticism.</p>

              <b>Interviews: 150+ questions</b><br>
              Childhood, family, ancestry, education, work, passions, ethical choices, personal philosophy. Sessions run online or offline, one-on-one or together with relatives. The scenario adapts to the person to capture sensory details, speech habits, and signature turns of phrase.

              <b>Analytics: language, emotions, structure</b><br>
              Audio is transcribed, segmented, and cleaned. Stories are clustered, episodes and characters are tagged, lexical profiles and emotional tones are mapped. We assemble a memory graph — the map of stories, people, places, and motives.

              <b>Dialogue layer: voice, style, access</b><br>
              A cognitive model becomes a virtual companion that replies in the person’s tone and tempo, cites sources, and shows where each answer comes from. Access can be private for the family or shared through the public Eternals Library.

        <h2>AI “Architect of Eternity”</h2>
        <p>Our custom AI module highlights episodes, builds the narrative map, finds lexical patterns, tracks emotional dynamics, and helps structure the Book of Life. It never invents facts — it works only with verified interviews, documents, and artefacts. An expert editorial layer validates personal data, clarifies ambiguities, and enforces ethical filters.</p>

        <div class="kicker">Edition</div>
        <h2>The Book of Life</h2>
        <p>The Book of Life is a designed biographical chronicle: chapters by era and theme, quotations, photographs, timelines, QR links to audio and video fragments. It can be a printed volume, an interactive PDF, or a web edition with advanced navigation. The editorial team captures a voice portrait so that signature words and intonations become the compass through memory.</p>

        <h2>The Eternals Library</h2>
        <p>The Eternals Library is a collection of public digital portraits of historical figures, philanthropists, scientists, teachers, and cultural leaders. It enables ethical educational dialogues: the style is reconstructed, sources are cited, and reconstruction limits are transparent. Teachers use the library as an interactive textbook; families and foundations use it as a memorial AI archive for exhibitions, audio guides, and themed events.</p>

        <h2>Security & ethics</h2>
        <p><strong>Data as a sanctuary.</strong> All personal data is encrypted; access levels are configured through family roles (family administrator, editor, reader). We record family consent, define transparent usage terms, host the materials on resilient infrastructure, and provide flexible access tiers.</p>
        <p><strong>Ethical principles.</strong> Respect for memory and personal autonomy, transparency of methods, clear separation of facts from interpretation, and labelling of reconstructed fragments. Sensitive topics follow the family’s wishes and pace.</p>
