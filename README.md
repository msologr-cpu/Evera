# Evera

EVERA | Portal between Life and Eternity. A multilingual platform that combines knowledge, philosophy, and technology. Includes donation support (crypto wallets), methodology, roadmap, cases, team, and the “Book of Life” - part of the Eternal Library project that connects past, present, and digital immortality.

## Maintaining the LLM sitemap

The list of pages used for LLM integrations lives in `ai/llm-sitemap.txt`. When you add, remove, or rename any HTML page under `pages/` or `en/pages/` (including new sections such as pricing, methodology, cases, team, etc.), update this file so it continues to reflect every published RU and EN page. Keep the paths relative to the repository root and place one page per line.
